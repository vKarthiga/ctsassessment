        The city council has announced a series of events this weekend, including live music,
        a farmer’s market, and a public art exhibit. Residents are encouraged to attend
        and participate in community-building activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteers are also needed for cleanup and hospitality booths. Signups are open
        on the city’s event portal. Free refreshments and community t-shirts will be available
        for all volunteers.
      </p>
      <p>
        New walking trails are being proposed near the Riverside Park area. Feedback
        from residents is welcome during next week’s town hall meeting.
